# Rails Decal Portal

This is the official classroom portal for the Ruby on Rails Decal. It was originally designed and developed by Aivant Goyal, Emily Zhong, Franco Franco, and Jemma Kwak. It is currently maintained by the course facilitators Aivant Goyal and Ethan Lee. 

It is open source with the following intentions:
1. Presenting a learning opportunity for students of the decal to explore the code that runs the platform they use weekly.
2. Letting any potential instructors of other courses have a course portal which they can also use to help facilitate their own courses.
3. Welcoming future updates to improve the course experience for everyone!
